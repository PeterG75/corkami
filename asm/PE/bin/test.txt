 * a normal PE
PE with many sections:
 * 96 sections (95 are empty)
 * a PE with 96 used code sections
TLS:
 * simple TLS:
  # 1st TLS call
  # EntryPoint executed
  # ExitProcess called
 * executed via imported TLS
 * TLS on the fly update started
  # adding 2nd TLS to callbacks
  # 2nd TLS executed. removing all TLS from callbacks to prevent further executions
 * fake TLS callbacks for obfuscation
 * fake exports to disrupt disassembly
Imports loading:
 * standard DLL import
 * no Import Name Table
 * extensions-less imported dlls (>= XP)
 * mixed-case imported dlls
DLL loading:
 * statically loaded DLL and export call
  # DLL EntryPoint called on attach
  # DLL export called
  # DLL EntryPoint called on detach
 * dynamically loaded DLL and export call
  # loading dll
  # DLL EntryPoint called on attach
  # DLL export called
  # unloading dll
  # DLL EntryPoint called on detach
 * loading DLL by Unicode
  # DLL EntryPoint called on attach
  # DLL EntryPoint called on detach
 * statically loaded DLL with weird export name
 * statically loaded DLL with empty export name
 * DLL export by ordinal called
 * DLL with no relocation (with direct call)
 * dynamically loading export-less DLL
  # loading dll
  # DLL EntryPoint called on attach
  # unloading dll
  # DLL EntryPoint called on detach
export forwarding:
 * forwarded import call via Export
 * forwarded import call via forwarding loops
bound imports:
 * export called (bound imports)
 * unexpected export called (corrupted bound imports)
 * export of an unexpected DLL called (corrupted bound imports)
tiny PE
 * 268b universal tiny PE (XP-W7x64)
ImageBase:
 * null IMAGEBASE (and relocations)
 * kernel range IMAGEBASE (and relocations)
 * decryption via relocations
EntryPoint:
 * null EntryPoint
 * virtual EntryPoint
 * external EntryPoint (in fixed address DLL)
sections:
 * virtually oversized section
 * several sections - including the header - with the same physical content
 * section table in appended data
 * NT headers in appended data
 * section table at the bottom of the file
 * last section truncated
 * sections in wrong physical order
