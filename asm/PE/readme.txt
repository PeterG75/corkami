this is Corkami PE files corpus: 
a set of handmade files showing the various possibilities of the Portable Executable format under Windows, XP and 7.

All these files are clean; however, they are hand-made and break the limits of the PE file format, so they might be detected as malicious or as corrupted files.

check bin\test*.txt for the descriptions of each binary
