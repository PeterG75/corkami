\begin{center}
detailed packers' features 
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
{\bf compression} & (used on top of compression algorithms)\\
\midrule
section merging 	& merge all sections (just one entry in the section table) \\
imports 		& imports are stored and loaded with a more compact import table format \\
imports by hash 	& exports are parsed until it matches a specific hash, instead of a $GetProcAddress$ call \\
call optimisation 	& turn relative operands of jumps and calls into absolute \ra better compression \\
resources		& compresses resources, avoiding critical ones (main icon, manifest,\ldots)\rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray} \\
\midrule
{\bf protection} & \\
\midrule
token check          & presence check to allow the program to run: {\tt dongle, CD/DVD, key, file, network\ldots} \\
fingerprinting	& token is specific to a hardware element: {\tt disk/OS/CPU/MAC/\ldots} \\
demo mode          & inclusion of a demo binary/mode that is executed when token is absent or not enough privileged \\
integrity		& check the contents are unmodified with checksum or hash \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\
\midrule
{\bf anti-analysis} & \\
\midrule
overlap		& jumping after the first byte of an instruction \\
illusion		& makes the analyst the something incorrect happened \\
junk			& insertion of dummy code between relevant opcodes \\
jumps			& insertion of jumps to makes analysis visually harder\\
polymorphism	& different but equivalent code \ra 2 packed files of the same source are different \\
self generation	& packer stub generates polymorphic code on the fly \ra same file executes differently \\
virtualization	& virtualizes (part of) packer stub code \ra harder analysis \\
stack			& strings are built and decrypted before use, then discarded \ra to avoid obvious references\\
faking			& add fake code similar to known packers to fool identifcation \\
thread		& use several parallel threads to make analysis harder \\
timing			& comparing time between two points to detect unusual execution \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\
\toprule
{\bf anti-debugging} & (and anti-tools, by extension) \\
\midrule
detect 		& detect the presence of an attached debugger: {\tt IsDebuggerPresent} \\
prevent		& prevent a debugger to attach to the target itself or stay attached \\
nuisance		& make debugger session difficult: {\tt BlockInput, slow down\ldots}\\
thread		& spawn a monitoring thread to detect tampering, breakpoints, \ldots\\
artifacts		& detects a debugger by its artifact: {\tt window title, device driver, exports, \ldots} \\
limitation		& prevent the use of a tool via a specific limitation \\
exploit		& prevent the use of a tool via a specific vulnerability \\
backdoor		& detect or crash a debugger via a specific backdoor \\
self-debugging	& debug itself to prevent another debugger to be attached \\
int1			& block interruption 1 \ra debuggers stop working \\
fake			& add code of known packer to fool identification \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\
\midrule
{\bf anti-dumping} & (prevent making a working executable from a memory image)\\
\midrule
tampering		& erase or corrupt specific file parts to prevent rebuilding (header, packer stub,\ldots) \\
imports 		& add obfuscation between imports calls and APIs (obfuscation, virtualization, stealing, \ldots)\\
on the fly		& API address is resolved before each use to prevent complete dumping \\
API hooking		& alter API behavior: {\tt redirect benign API to a critical one} \ra dump not working \\
inlining		& copy locally the whole content of API code \ra no more 'import calls'\\
relocate		& relocate API code in separate buffer \ra calls don't lead to imported DLLs\\
byte stealing	& move the first bytes of the original code elsewhere \ra harder rebuilding and bypasses breakpoints\\
page guard	 	& blocks of code are encrypted individually, and decrypted temporarily only upon execution \\
flow			& flow opcodes are removed and emulated (or decrypted) by the packer during execution \ra incorrect dump\\
virtualization	& virtualizes (part of) original code, API start\ldots \ra dump not working without VM code \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\

\midrule
{\bf anti-emulation} & \\
\midrule
opcodes		& using different opcodes sets (FPU, MMX, SSE) to block emulators\\
undoc			& use of rare or undocumented opcodes to block non-exhaustive emulators \\
API			& unusual APIs are called to block non-exhaustive emulators (anti-virus)\\
loop			& extra loops are added to make time-constraint emulators give up \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\
\midrule
{\bf bundlers} & \\
\midrule
drop			& original file is written to disk then executed \\
injection		& original file is injected in existing process \ra no new file on disk + higher privileges \\
hooking		& file handling APIs are modified to make embedded files usable like external ones \rowcolors{0}{white}{lightgray}\\

%;    metamorphism        replacing opcodes with equivalent ones (real polymorphism) inc al <> add al, 1
%;    endomorphism       replacing operands, like swapping registers. Ex: replacing eax with another reg in mov eax, [mem] cmp eax, value  jnz exit
%;    oligomorphism
